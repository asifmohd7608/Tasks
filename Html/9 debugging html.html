    <h2>Errors can be of 2 types</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>syntax error</li>
        <li>logical error</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>syntax errors</b> are very common and easy to fix.these type of errors arises due to missing of opening or closing tags, or spelling or punctuations</p>

    <p><b>logical errors</b> are those errors where syntax is correct , but the code isn't outputting what you intend it to</p>

    <p>Html doesnt suffer alot  from syntax errors because, the browser parse it permissively, meaning the browser will try to fix the syntax error as much as it can and wont throw many error.but this doesnt mean the code is error free or it will work as we expect.it will be okay to look through a few lines of html to find the error, but what if the html is too complex and long.in those cases we can use an Html validation service </p>

    <h2>Html Validation</h2>

    <p>For validating an Html, we can use some validation services like the one from w3c.we can copy the html to the w3c validation page and submit.this will return a report of the errors in the html if any. using there these error messages we can fix our code</p>
